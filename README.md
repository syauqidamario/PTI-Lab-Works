Here is the repository for my practical assignments/works from my Introduction to Internet Technology course. This course basically covers the basics of the frontend aspects of web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

System Requirements :

1) Any kind of browser, Google Chrome is preferable (since I run these projects on Google Chrome)

2) Laragon or XAMPP for web-hosting tools
